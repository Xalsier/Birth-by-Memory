- Solved that one issue where the SVG will show the wrong colors for a split second 
on slow internet. The solution was just baking the fill colors and data into the svg.
- Error Sandbox path if src directions are wrong. Using this to test the fallback.
- Added a fallback image for slow internet by putting the fallback svg as a background-image, 
and putting a transparent empty.png through css 'content' to get rid of the image border.
- The flickering of the waves was caused by the page resizing, so I removed the resizing 
entirely and forced a 1000px width.

- Removed fallback css as I hadn't tested it with an actual image.
